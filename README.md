Dashboard project providing 3 input responsive visualizations from a dataset pertaining to bacteria found in the human navel. The user may select any participant ID to see the top 10 bacteria found as a bar chart, the frequency of washing the navel as a gauge chart, and the full list of bacteria found as a bubble chart. All visualizations were generated from JavaScript using D3 and plotly, and the html was styled using Bootstrap and external css.
